# Python Assignment â€“ Lists, Dictionaries, and if Statements

## How to run (beginner steps)
1. Open a terminal in this folder (or open VS Code here and use its Terminal).
2. Run each file like this:
   - `python src/part_a.py`
   - `python src/part_b.py`
   - `python src/part_c.py`
   - `python src/part_d.py`
   - `python src/part_e.py`
   - `python src/part_f.py`
3. Read `part_g_answers.txt` for the reflection answers.

## Quick Git steps (push to your `pythonWorks` repo)
> Assumes you already cloned `pythonWorks` and are on your branch.

```bash
# 0) See where you are
pwd

# 1) Copy this whole folder into your pythonWorks project (or move the files).

# 2) From inside your pythonWorks folder:
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Add Python assignment parts A-F and reflection answers (Part G)"
git push
```

If you need to create a new branch first:
```bash
git checkout -b my-assignment-branch
# then add/commit/push as above
```

If your default Python command is `python3`, use that instead of `python`.
