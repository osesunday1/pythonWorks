Part G – Reflection (simple answers)

1) Why check if a list or dictionary is empty?
Because empty means “nothing to use yet.” If we don’t check, our program might do nothing or confuse the user. A quick check lets us show a helpful message.

2) How are dictionaries more powerful than lists for real-world data?
Lists hold items in order. Dictionaries use labels (keys) like name, age, GPA, so we can grab the exact thing quickly.

3) Why use a list of dictionaries?
When we have many similar records (many students/books), each record is a dictionary. Putting them in a list makes it easy to loop through them.

4) Multiple if statements vs. if-elif-else?
Use if-elif-else when only ONE choice should happen.
Use multiple separate ifs when MORE THAN ONE condition might be true and should happen.
