"""Q3 â€” List Processing (mutation vs copies + while loop)

Functions:
- process_tasks(pending, completed): move tasks from pending -> completed using a while loop,
  printing 'Processing: <task>' for each item. MUTATES both lists.
- show_completed(completed): print each completed task on its own line.

Demo:
1) Process a sample list of 4+ tasks and show the completed list.
2) Process using a COPY of the pending list (pending[:] ) to prove the original pending stays unchanged.
